# **Unyx Engine 3**  
*Version: 3.11.5 | Ongoing Development*  
An advanced, high-performance game engine designed for both indie developers and large-scale productions. **Unyx Engine 3** combines powerful graphics, efficient workflows, and a highly customizable environment to enable the creation of cutting-edge interactive experiences.

---

## **Notes**  

> [!NOTE]  
> **Unyx Engine 3** is a closed-source game engine inspired by the best aspects of **Unreal Engine**, **Unity**, and **Cry Engine** but it is an entirely original creation. With a focus on providing high-quality visuals, robust performance, and flexibility, **Unyx Engine 3** is built to handle everything from small indie projects to large-scale AAA game productions.

> [!TIP]  
> The engine includes a highly optimized rendering pipeline, extensive asset management, advanced physics simulations, and powerful in-editor toolsâ€”all designed to deliver results on par with industry-standard engines like Unreal Engine 4.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The **Unyx Engine 3** interfaces use Epic Games Unreal Engine's **Slate UI Framework**, We felt it was the best to use rather than standard ImGui.

> [!WARNING]  
> **Unyx Engine 3** is closed source and is not publicly available. It is a private project, and access is restricted to a select group of developers. The source code is proprietary and will not be released for public use.
